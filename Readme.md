﻿Music Genre Classifier

Minor Project 2




**Introduction**

Genre classification is an important task with many real world applications. As the quantity of music being released on a daily basis continues to sky-rocket, especially on internet platforms such as Soundcloud and Spotify – a 2016 number suggests that tens of thousands of songs were released every month on Spotify – the need for accurate meta-data required for database management and search/storage purposes climbs in proportion.

Being able to instantly classify songs in any given playlist or library by genre is an important functionality for any music streaming/purchasing service, and the capacity for statistical analysis that correct and complete labeling of music and audio provides is essentially limitless.

**Motivation**

Music genre classification forms a basic step for building a strong recommendation system. The idea behind this project is to see how to handle sound files in python, compute sound and audio features from them, run Machine Learning Algorithms on them, and see the results.

In a more systematic way, the main aim is to create a machine learning model, which classifies music samples into different genres. It aims to predict the genre using an audio signal as its input.

The objective of automating the music classification is to make the selection of songs quick and less cumbersome. If one has to manually classify the songs or music, one has to listen to a whole lot of songs and then select the genre. This is not only time-consuming but also difficult. Automating music classification can help to find valuable data such as trends, popular genres, and artists easily. Determining music genres is the very first step towards this direction.

**Related Work**

In the past 5-10 years, however, convolutional neural networks have shown to be incredibly accurate music genre classifiers , with excellent results reflecting both the complexity provided by having multiple layers and the ability of convolutional layers to effectively identify patterns within images (which is essentially what mel-spectrograms and MFCCs are). These results have far exceeded human capacity for genre classification, with our research finding that current state-of-the-art models perform with an accuracy of around 91%  when using the full 30s track length. Many of the papers which implemented CNNs compared their models to other ML techniques, including k-NN, mixture of Gaussians, and SVMs, and CNNs performed favorably in all cases. Therefore we decided to focus our efforts on implementing a high-accuracy CNN .



**Dataset**

For this project, the dataset that we will be working with is [GTZAN](https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification/activity) Genre Classification

dataset which consists of 1,000 audio tracks, each 30 seconds long. It contains 10 genres, each represented by 100 tracks.

The dataset has the following folders:

- **Genres original** — A collection of 10 genres with 100 audio files each, all having a length of 30 seconds (the famous GTZAN dataset, the MNIST of sounds)
- **Images original** — A visual representation for each audio file. One way to classify data is through neural networks because NN’s usually take in some sort of image representation.
- **2 CSV files** — Containing features of the audio files. One file has for each song (30 seconds long) a mean and variance computed over multiple features that can be extracted from an audio file. The other file has the same structure, but the songs are split before into 3 seconds audio files.
